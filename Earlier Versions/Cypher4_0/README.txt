NEW WITH CYPHER 4

Makefile creates 3 binaries. The main Cypher opens the user menu while encode and decode are now the commands that are directly executed from the console. They only use the standard encoding but next the mixed coding will be developed for version 5.

Once again, don't take this serious.
