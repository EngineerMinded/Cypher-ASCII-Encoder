Candace Owens just said that Native Americans were cannibals, high on drugs and it's impossible to know anything about their history because they are mostly dead. She said this, while being recorded talking to a group of students about her hatred of Trans people.

She said to Bill Maher that climate change does not exist and that it's just the latest scaremongering fad. She knows this because, when she was growing up, everyone was worried about and talking about "global cooling". Maher said "no-one was talking about global cooling" and she said "yes, they were". This is the level of intellect of this person who also thinks that Avery and Dassey are guilty without knowing jackshit about the case.

Fast forward to 9:30, where Columbus explains that it's OK to enslave Native Americans, since every culture does it. Then he says, "Being taken as a slave is better than being killed, no? I don't see the problem."

Columbus also speaks with an awful Spanish accent and says "caramba" a lot, despite being Italian. Aren't you glad that schoolkids will now be learning their history from these videos?
